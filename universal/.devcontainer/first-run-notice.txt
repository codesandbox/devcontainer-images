🔍 To explore VS Code to its fullest, search using the Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P or F1).

🔥 We automatically snapshot your VM when it hibernates, so you can get back to coding within 2 seconds after a break.

🗒️ We’re running VSCode in the browser, you can install your own extensions and set your own keybindings/settings. You can also open this environment in your own VSCode.
